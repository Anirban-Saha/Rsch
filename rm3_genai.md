II. METHODOLOGY

*A. Generative Adversarial Networks.*

The Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) are the best

algorithm for Deepfake and it combines two neural networks

that are capable of creating realistic images. This machine

learning technique is capable for learning from the collection

of images and then it creates an image which looks authentic

to human eyes just by combining these images, for example,

with help of GAN we can create realistic images, of animals,

clothes design and anything else for which GAN is trained

for [3]. The generative adversarial networks combine two

neural networks, one of them is called generator and the

other one is the discriminator. Generator is the neural

network which tries to generate the fake images from the

images data set which is provided to it and it tries to generate

a realistic images and the discriminator is the other neural

network which evaluates the images produced by the

generator for authenticity of the images, it helps in

generating more realistic images which look real to human

eyes. The generator and discriminator are being trained in

min-max method [2]. The min represents 0 and max

represents 1. The 0 represents fake output and 1 represent the

authentic output. Discriminator tries to get closer to 1 in

order to create a realistic Deepfake. The generative

adversarial network needs a longer time to reach max value

for generating better output. If we train the generator and

discriminator for a longer duration, then it will help in

generating more realistic and authentic Deepfake images and

then it will be used for swapping the face of person A with

person B in the video.

I. INTRODUCTION

Over the past few years, Technology is advancing rapidly

and it is influencing the Cyber world availability and because

of this access and availability of social media platform is

additionally growing in numbers. Now social media

platforms are used for expressing individual view and

opinion. Now information about anything is available on the

internet in vast majorities and the internet era has provided

an opportunity to share information on the web with each

other. Now internet can be easily accessed by anyone

because of this people are started spreading fake news and

rumours by misusing it. Deepfake is one of them and it is the

concept of swapping the face of one person to another using

a generative adversarial network algorithm. The output of

this algorithm is very realistic and authentic to human eyes

[1]. Deepfake is the technologies which will make people do

things which they never did in the past. Now people are

using this technology for spreading the fake news against

people by swapping their face in the video. It is also used for

character assassination and taking revenge from people. This

technique is very potent because its output is very authentic

as the algorithm work on the tribulation and error method.

The algorithm generates a fake image and then it compares it

with the real image just to make sure the output looks much

more realistic and it carries out this task until it gets the

*B. How Generative Adversarial Networks works.*

which has lots of CUDA cores for processing image data sets

which will help in generating better Deepfake and we need

data sets of a high resolution images because these images

will be cropped and re-sized according to the face orientation

of the target person. This will result in authentic Deepfake

for swapping person face in the video and it will look real to

human eyes. For generating the result, generative adversarial

network is used which will help in creating Deepfake images

of the target person and then we will use those Deepfake

images to swap the face of the person in the target video. We

have collected some image data sets of Henry Cavill and

Christopher Reeve, and then we have cropped the face of

both person to 256 pixels and removed all the blurred images

from the data sets. Then we started the training of neural

networks for generation of faces and these faces are getting

evaluated by the discriminators.

**Fig. 1** Face swapping Generative Adversarial Networks architecture for

generating Deepfake video.

Generative Adversarial Networks is the most important

neural networks and it is part of machine learning. It is a

fusion of two neural network generator and discriminator.

The generator takes two data sets 1 and 2. These data sets

consist of images of two different people. The generator tries

to combines these two images to create a fake image and

then the image goes to the discriminator. The discriminator is

the second neural network which will compare the fake

image with the real images for the authenticity of the fake

image. If the fake image doesn't look authentic to the

discriminator, then it will reject it and then the generator will

create another fake image and again it is validated for the **Fig. 2** The images are taken while training the Neural Networks and images

of Henry Cavill and Christopher Reeve are used as data sets which will be

used for generating Deepfake.

authenticity. The discriminator tries to produce accurate

output by comparing the fake image with the original

images. The algorithm will go in a loop until it finds an

The Fig. 2 is taken when the Neural Networks is training

authentic fake image for Deepfake. GNA uses Mathematical for generating Deepfake images. These images are start and

value function ***V(G,D)* G** represents generator and **D** end screen of training. In the start, there were only 2 columns

represent discriminator [2]. The value function is given by and at the end, all columns are filled with Deepfake images

equation 1:

which are generated by generator neural network. The first

column consists of Christopher Reeve images and the third

column consist for Henry Cavill and the other remaining

<b><i><sup>minG max</sup>D <sup>V(D,G) = Ex~ρ(x)[log D(x)] + Ez~ρ(z)[log(1-D(G(z)))]</sup></i> …… (1)</b></sup>

The generative adversarial network works on min-max column is for neural networks to train by combining the

method. The value function ***V(G,D)*** is used for creating faces of both actors to generate the realistic Deepfake images

authentic images. The discriminator ***D*** and it remember data and later we will use these images to swap Henry Cavill in

expectation and the maximization of this equation allow ***D*** to Learning curves of the generator and the discriminator neural

predict precisely ***D(x)=1 when x~ρ(x).*** The next equation is network. To generate realistic Deepfake we have used

for Generator ***G*** which tries to convince discriminator. images with closed and open eyes for creating eye blinking

discriminator is very time consuming and the longer we train

the neural networks it will help in generating the authentic

output. Once the discriminator gets the correct values after

training several days the generator and discriminator will

reach a point where both of them cannot improve further. At

this point, the generator will start generating realistic

Deepfake images and discriminator will not be able to

differentiate between the generated Deepfakes [4]. Once the

discriminator gets the accurate image it can now be used for

swapping the face in the video to create a Deepfake.

**Fig. 3** The above images are taken from movie the justice league in the

original image the superman is played by Henry Cavill and the second image

is a Deepfake image in which the face is swapped with Christopher Reeve

To generate a perfect and authentic Deepfake we need to who played the role of Superman in late '70s.

train the algorithm for more time and it required good

processing power. The better graphic card you use will result

in better Deepfake images. We need a high end graphic card

video which was taken from the Justice League movie which

was released in 2017 using the Generative Adversarial

Networks. Henry Cavill played the role of Superman in 2017

and Christopher Reeve played the role of Superman in the

late '70s. The video looks very authentic and the human eye

will not be able to differentiate between the original and the

fake video. This output image shows that if we trained the

generative model with good image data sets then it will

generate authentic images which can be used for swapping

the face in the video, it will become very difficult for human

eyes to suspect any changes made in the video. The

Generative Adversarial Networks is an optimal algorithm for

generating authentic Deepfake. The video is nothing but a

collection of images which are played at 30 frames per

There are some advantages of using Deepfake

technology if it is the used in correct and proper way. The

most important use of deep-fakes comes under education

and art [7].

*A. Deepfake in field of education.*

The Deepfake is capable of generating fake video by

swapping the face of the person. This quality of Deepfake

can help a lot in the field of education [7]. We can create a

Deepfake of freedom fighters, scientist, doctors and any

other person who invented new thing and now they are

dead. Deepfake can create a fake video of these people

second in order to make a video [5]. So, with the help of which will help the student in their studies. It will be an

Generative Adversarial Networks, we are editing and innovative way of teaching student which will increase the

modifying on each frame, with this we are able to edit the interest of student towards the study. Deepfake will help in

video in such a way so that it will look realistic even after creating videos of the historical figure which will

modification. This can be only possible with good data sets communicate directly to students [7].

and a high-end computer with good processing power [6].

The data sets should be of high-resolution images with a

similar facial feature, skin tones and the images should be

*B. Deepfake in film and art creation.*

taken under the same lighting condition. With this, we have

Deepfake is capable of swapping face in videos and

created the Deepfake image and swapped actor face in Fig 3. images with a realistic look and feel. There are some

scenarios in the film where the film creator wants to change

the face of actors due to some reasons. In fast and furious 7

when the actor Paul Walker died in a car accident then his

brother Cody Walker who looks similar to Paul finished the

last scene in the Movie. Think if he has no brother then in

that case the film producer has to use lots of money in CGI

and video editing for swapping the face in the movie or they

have to start shooting of movie from the scratch. For

swapping the face in movies with CGI and video editing, the

editor needs to be a skilled person then only it will work and

it required lots of money. But if we use Deepfake for

**Fig. 4** The above images are taken from movie Goldfinger in the original swapping the face of actors in movies then it will only cost

image the role of James Bond is played by Sean Connery and the second

image is a Deepfake image in which the face is swapped with Elon Musk.

for high-end computer and it required a few months to swap

the face in the movies. This technique is very effective and

costs saving. In Star Wars Rogue One CGI was used to

show a younger version of Princess Leia which is portrayed

by Carrie Fisher, they used lots of money and skilled person

for that, it would be done using Deepfake which would have

saved lots of money and time.

In Fig. 4, we have swapped Sean Connery face with Elon

Musk face. Fig. 4 is a screenshot of a small video of the

movie Goldfinger in which the actor Sean Connery played

the role of James Bond. The Generative Adversarial

Networks is a very powerful algorithm which helps in

swapping of the face in the video. Fig. 4 is another example

of Deepfake video which we have generated using *C. Deepfake for pattern and design creation.*

Generative Adversarial Networks. We followed the same

Deepfake is one of the best techniques which learn and

procedure as we did for Fig. 3 in which we swapped Henry

Cavill face with Christopher Reeve face. This shows that if

we have good data sets for training Neural networks then it

will help in generating better output which looks authentic to

human eyes. The changes in the above images are hardly

recognizable due to the similarities between the images

which have similar facial features, same skin tones and

images shot under similar lightning conditions. The

Deepfake technology requires lot of training and good

processing power for generating Deepfakes. Even though it

is optimal algorithm sometimes neural networks are trained

generate output from multiple inputs. It is used for face

swapping but it can also be used for generating images. In

fashion industry design and patterns play a very important

role and as the time passes designer come up with new

design and pattern for clothes. This technique can be used in

creating pattern and design from the combination of old

design and patterns which help the fashion designer in

creating a new design for cloth foot-wears, bag, and wallets

with the help of generative adversarial network, the designer

will create a new design by providing images of cloth and

properly but they are not able to swap the face in the video if bag they can generate new shoes or by providing images of

the data set contains blurred images and sometimes the shoes and wallet it will generate a design for cloth. If

images are not taken under same lightning condition. Even Deepfake is used in the fashion industry, it will save lots of

though the Deepfake is optimal technique it has some time and effort of designer for creating new design and

advantages, drawbacks and limitations.

patterns. Now the developer has started creating an app

which can be used by novice person and you have to

provide images and it will train algorithm and generate a face in the video. If this technology is used against politician

new design from it.

then it will damage their reputation and character. The

attacker will make them appear in the place where

politicians never visited and making them behave badly with

people which they never did. The Adobe Company is

IV. DISADVANTAGES OF DEEPFAKE

This technology was created for entertainment purpose working on an application which will work as Photoshop of

but now as the Deepfake gaining popularity its miss use has audio which was demonstrated by Adobe developer Zeyu

been increased. This technique is now being used for Jin on Adobe MAX conference 2016 in San Diego,

character defamation of celebrities and high-profile California. It is like the text to speech Software which is

politician just by swapping the face with someone else. This capable of learning human voice and then giving output in

technique could be problematic if it is utilized in unethical that particular person voice and it was demonstrated by

ways. The most important disadvantages of Deepfake are as Adobe developer Zeyu Jin in the conference [8]. So if

follows:

people used these two technologies together then it will

become harmful and it will be used in altering the election

just by defaming the politician in a situation which they

never did. It is a big threat to democracy which will change

the outcome of the election.

*A. Individual character defamation and assassination*

Deepfake is capable of making a dead person alive just

by swapping the face in the video. It can be used against any

individual for defaming the character of an individual

person. it will become harmful for a person because it will

show the thing which he didn't do. The impact of the video

will be much higher because people will believe what they

saw in the fake video and it will become difficult for the

individual to prove he is innocent and did nothing. It will

lead to a person character assassination just by using fake

video to defame his character.

*E. Deepfake is a threat to law enforcement agencies.*

In many court cases if we want to prove if someone is

guilty or not, we use evidence like voice, CCTV footage,

witness and images because these are the strong pieces of

evidence against any criminal and it will help in taking the

decision against them. This evidence provides valuable

information against the criminal and it can be used against

anyone just by swapping the face of criminal with an

innocent person to create a Deepfake and it will portray an

innocent person doing the criminal activity which he never

did and it can be used as evidence against the person. As the

technology improving the output is also getting better and it

is becoming hard to detect Deepfake. NVidia has created

Style-Based Generator for Generative Adversarial Networks

which is capable of generating face which look very

accurate and it is hard to detect whether it is fake or real [9].

If these things are used as evidence, then it will be a disaster

for law enforcement agencies.

*B. Spreading fake news with Deepfake.*

The Deepfake is now improving day by day and its flaws

are getting fixed as the technology getting popular. The

output of the Deepfake is getting much better day by day

and it looks authentic to human eyes and it getting very

difficult to distinguish between real and fake video. People

start spreading fake news with evidence which looks

authentic to user and this is not new, previously people use

to do it by spreading fake message on social media and now

they are doing it with fake video which works as icing on

the cake because it's impact will be much more high.

V. DEEPFAKE DETECTION TECHNIQUES

*A. Detecting ‘Deepfake’ videos by the blinking of an eye.*

*C. Using Deepfake against celebrities.*

Deepfake is capable of making the thing real which

never happened but for that, we need lots of images for

making the fake video which looks realistic to human eyes

and the algorithm take lots of time just to create the perfect

combination of images. As the algorithm need lots of

processing power and not everyone owns a high-end system

for making the Deepfake and because of this sometimes the

algorithm generates inappropriate video which can be easily

detected by human eyes. As the misuse of Deepfake is

increasing day by day so it becomes necessary to spread

awareness about this technique and develop some way in

which it can be easily detected. Sometime Deepfake can be

easily detected by human eyes just by looking to face

because the images generated by this algorithm sometime

were not able to mimic blinking of an eye [10]. This method

becomes very useful in detecting Deepfake because there

are 3 types of blinking of the eye, such as spontaneous

Deepfake was created for entertainment purpose and

now it is being used as weapons against celebrities for

character assassination. In 2017 people started targeting

celebrity by a making fake adult video of them by swapping

their face with an adult actress in the video. In old days’

people used image editing software and video editing

software for swapping the face of actresses and it was easy

to detect such changes in images but the result of Deepfake

look very authentic and convincing to human eyes. This one

is the major disadvantage of Deepfake because people

started using this for making a fake adult video of

celebrities. Deepfake made celebrities to suffer a lot because

it is a threat to their public image and their fame and it is

affecting very badly because people easily believe in such

rumors.

*D. Deepfake is a threat to democracy.*

Deepfake is now creating the boom of fake new and it is blinking, reflex blinking and voluntary blinking [11]. A

spreading like fire and people who are not aware of this normal person blinks in between 1 to 10 sec and this cannot

technology are becoming the victim because they think it is be possible with Deepfake unless and until you provide

an authentic content as Deepfake is capable of swapping images of a person with a closed and open eye. So, this can

be a very important technique through which Deepfake can data sets and it makes more time consuming some time we

do not get desired images which we required for data sets.

*B. Detecting Deepfake with MesoNet.*

*B. Training and swapping is time-consuming.*

MesoNet is capable of automatically detecting facing

To train the generative adversarial network for Deepfake

tampering in the Deepfake video using deep learning [12]. it required lots of time because it very slow process it might

This method tells the difference between computer- take weeks for generating a realistic output. As the

generated images and real images in the Deepfake video by algorithm works with two neural network generator and

using two network architecture meso-4 and mesoinception- discriminator, the generator generates the output and it is

4\. The main purpose of these two architectures is to detect evaluated by the discriminator it verifies whether the image

facial video forgery with high accuracy and it can will look authentic to human eyes and if the image is fine

differentiate between image property such as image noise, then it will start the swapping process or else it tells

image accuracy, classification and aggregation of the image. generator to generate another image and the process goes.

After analyzing these features of the image, the both meso-4 The algorithm needs a minimum of 72 hours’ hour or more

and mesoinception-4 are capable of detecting the Deepfake for training and then it will take time for swapping which

video with the accuracy of 95% to 98%. The Deepfake is become more time-consuming. Then we get a realistic

new way of enhancing Deepfake which look more authentic

to human eyes and people using this video for spreading

fake news and videos. The mesoNet technique can provide

an aid to detecting such fake videos and help in preventing

fake news and video which are created through Deepfake.

Training and swapping are heavy process and it requires

a lot of graphics processing because CPU will take time in

processing those images. So, it is not possible to generate a

Deepfake without a graphics card and that is why not

everyone can do it. For this, we need a very high-end

*C. Detection Of Deepfake Using Recurrent Neural Network*

Previously only a few people have the knowledge about computer which can handle both training and swapping

the Deepfake algorithm and now it is becoming more process. That’s why only a few people with good graphics

popular and the developer is making an app which made processing power are able to generate it. The cost of graphic

Deepfake easier and now laymen can create Deepfake with card is very high not everyone can afford it. This makes the

a much easier process using the fake app. Recurrent Neural Deepfake technique vey costlier.

Networks is another way of detecting the Deepfake video

[13]. Deepfake Video Detection Using Recurrent Neural

*D. Similar faces and skin tones of people.*

Networks. The concept behind this to train the convolutional

neural network for extracting the feature of images and then

training the Recurrent Neural Networks for detecting if any

changes are made in the video. RNN long-short-term-

memory (LSTM) is capable of remembering the previous

output which is used as input in the next step. CNN is the

best known for its visual recognition and if it is combined

with LSTM it can easily detect changes in the frames and

then this information is used for detecting the Deepfake

which are created using the fake app. fake app is not full-

fledged software and it generates video with inconsistency

and it can be easily detected by recurrent neural network.

In order to make a realistic Deepfake we need people

with similar faces and skin tones because if the feature of

both person x and person y is not similar then it will result

in terrible Deepfake which can be easily detected. So, the

feature of the face needs to be same if person x has the

beard then person y should also have the beard otherwise it

will not work and the skin tone of person x need to be

similar with person y because it will not look authentic to

human eyes.

*E. Sometime output is not optimal.*

Sometimes the output of the neural networks are good

but while swapping the orientation of face is not matched

with the target video then the output of Deepfake video is

not optimal. Deepfake which is not optimal can be easily

identified by human eyes. When the swapping of the face is

VI. LIMITATIONS OF DEEPFAKE

*A. Need lots of image data set.*

No doubt Deepfake is very powerful technology. As said not done properly then, if the person moves his head in

with great power come great responsibility. In order to make different directions then we can easily identify if there is

realistic Deepfake video we need lots of images of person x something wrong in the video and anyone can detect and

and person y whose face we want to swap. At least we need identify if the video is fake or not by looking at the face.

thousands of images in order to train the algorithm to learn This kind of mistake happens in Deepfake when we don't

and generate the authentic and realistic Deepfake and it’s build the image data sets with faces in a different direction

not possible to get 1000 of images of person until and unless and similar skin tone of both people. This happens a lot in

he is celebrity of V.I.P. Even though you get 1000 of images Deepfake because it's difficult to get images of faces in

of them it’s not possible to generate a Deepfake which can different directions and similar skin tone.

mimic blinking of eyes because nobody posts images with

closed eyes. This is the major problem with the Deepfake.

So we need to extract images from the videos to create the

VII. CONCLUSION

This survey paper draws the conclusion that using

Deepfake technique with the generative adversarial network

can generate an output, which looks realistic to human eyes. [11] Matteo Bologna and Rocco Agostino and Bruno De Gregori and

Daniele Belvisi and Donatella Ottaviani and C. Colosimo and

Generative Adversarial Network creates a fake image by

combining two different images but the images of person A

and person B need to similar in terms of facial feature and

skin tone and the images must be taken under the same

lighting condition. Deepfake can be used in two ways either

in good ways by implementing Deepfake in education

domain for changing faces of historical people and using

them as study material, and in arts it can be used for

swapping face of actors in movies which will save lots of

money from using CGI and VFX, and Deepfake can help in

generating design and pattern for the fashion industry.

Deepfake technique can be misused. For spreading fake new

by swapping the face of people in the video and it will make

them do the thing which they never did. Deepfake can be

used for defaming political leaders which will influence the

result of an election. Most dangerous use of Deepfake is to

taking revenge from another person by swapping his face in

adult movies and the female celebrities are becoming the

victim of Deepfake. There are different ways through which

we can detect whether the video is Deepfake by using

different algorithm Even though Deepfake is an optimal

technique for generating fake video. This technique is more

optimal because its output looks very realistic and authentic

to human eyes, which make it more optimal and harder to

detect.
